    <h2>Former Kerala minister M A Kuttappan no more</h2>
    <p>Senior Congress leader and former minister M A Kuttappan died at a private hospital here following an illness on
        Tuesday night, party sources said. He was 76.
        Kuttappan is survived by his wife and two children.
        A multiple-time MLA, Kuttappan had served as minister for Welfare of the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and
        Backward Classes in the A K Antony ministry in 2001.
        During his long political career, he also served as a general secretary and executive committee member of the
        KPCC, a senate member of the Calicut University, and Railway Recruitment Board member.
        Hailing from Mallappally in Pathanamthitta district, Kuttappan was an MBBS graduate and a practising medical
        doctor.
        He quit his medical profession to embark on a career in politics after being attracted to the principles of the
        Congress.
        
        After joining the party in 1978, he represented Wandoor, Chelakkara and Njarakkal constituencies in the state
        Assembly during various years.
        He withdrew from active politics some years ago due to health reasons, Congress sources added.
        Leader of Opposition in the Assembly V D Satheesan was among those who condoled the senior politician’s death.

    <h2>Bengal Panchayat Polls: TMC candidate’s husband shot at, CPM nominee’s shop set on fire</h2>
    <p>The last day for withdrawing nominations for the July 8 panchayat elections in West Bengal was marred by
        incidents of violence and clashes in different parts of the state on Tuesday with the Opposition alleging that
        their candidates were being forced by the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) to drop out from the poll race. The
        TMC, however, denied the charge.
        A TMC candidate’s husband, who also works for the party, was shot at on Monday night at Konamukta village under
        Gitaldah gram panchayat in Cooch Behar district.
        Azizur Rahman, whose wife Dolly Khatun is a TMC candidate, was returning home when a group of men allegedly beat
        him up and shot him in the leg. Rahman was shifted to Cooch Behar Medical College and Hospital after his
        condition deteriorated at a Dinhata hospital. “When we were returning from a party meeting, BJP workers started
        arguing with us. There was a fight and then they fired at us. I was shot in the leg,” Rahman told the police.
        “One person was injured in a clash between two groups. However, the situation is now under control,” said a
        police officer. TMC alleged that BJP-backed supporters were behind the incident. But the BJP denied the charge.
        BJP’s Dinhata city mandal president Ajay Roy said, “The incident was a fallout of infighting in TMC.”

    <h2>6 yrs after big launch, NAMO tablets for students likely to be replaced with laptops</h2>
    <p>Six years after the grand launch of the NAMO (New Avenues of Modern Education) Tablet Yojana, the state
        government in Gujarat is mulling replacing it with a laptop scheme, The Indian Express has learnt. The tablet
        scheme has been mired in controversies due to the delay in the distribution of devices to students which was
        followed by a brief suspension, triggering criticism from opposition parties.

        Sources in the Education Department in the state revealed similar laptop schemes in other states are being
        studied. “A report of how other states are implementing such schemes and its feasibility is being worked out at
        the moment,” a senior official privy to the development revealed.

        Apart from the controversies, laptops are being considered due to the “utility” factor. “As laptops are more
        useful for college students than tablets, it makes sense to offer them what they can have an optimal benefit
        of,” the official added.
        In the meantime, a technical committee constituted by the Education Department — after the agency concerned
        failed to meet the listed specifications for the NAMO e-tablets — is scheduled to meet this week.

        “The committee is going to take a call on the issue of the agency that was technically not meeting the required
        specification,” Banchha Nidhi Pani, Commissioner, Technical Education, told The Indian Express. A decision is
        expected following the meeting.
        Thousands of students had been waiting for NAMO e-tablets for several years. The delay was linked to the
        suspension of schemes for nearly three years.

        Amid the procurement delay, the backlog kept swelling, and rose up to 9,75,000, an official said. Around 3 lakh
        students each took admission in degree or diploma in 2020-21 and 2021-22, and there was a backlog of 75,000 from
        2019-20, while 3,00,000 students got added in the academic session 2022-23, he added.
        The state government could barely provide tablets to less than 10 per cent of eligible students, as per the
        details available.

        The NAMO Tablet Yojana was launched in the academic session 2017-18 amid much fanfare by the then Chief Minister
        Vijay Rupani who had equated these tablets to “Lord Krishna’s Sudarshan Chakra (spinning wheel) that will bring
        knowledge at fingertips”. At the massive event in August 2017, he stated the “BJP government does not view the
        youth as a vote bank… but new age power”.

        In its 2017-18 budget, the state government announced a scheme of handing out tablets at a price of Rs 1,000,
        against the claimed market price of Rs 7,000-Rs 8,000, to all students who had cleared Class 12 in 2016-17 and
        were pursuing degree or diploma courses in any college or university.
