            <h2>Apply on Hindus first: Opposition slams PM Modi’s Uniform Civil Code pitch</h2>
            <div class="col">

                <p>Hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi batted for the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) pitch while
                    addressing BJP workers in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, Opposition parties slammed him for his remarks
                    and called it an attack on “India’s pluralism and diversity”.By India Today News Desk: Hours after
                    Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a pitch for the Uniform Civil
                    Code (UCC) and lashed out at the opposition for playing "vote bank politics"</p>

                <p>Attacking the Opposition while addressing BJP workers under the ‘Mera Booth Sabse Majboot’ campaign
                    in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday, PM Modi said the people are being instigated in the name of
                    the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). He also asked how the country can function with dual laws that govern
                    personal matters, and accused the Opposition of using the UCC issue to "mislead and provoke" the
                    Muslim community.</p>

                <p>PM Modi said, “Will a family function if there are two different sets of rules for people? Then how
                    will a country run? Our Constitution too guarantees equal rights to all people.”"India's PM
                    considers India's diversity and its pluralism a problem. So, he says such things...Will you strip
                    the country of its pluralism and diversity in the name of a UCC? When he speaks of UCC, he is
                    speaking of the Hindu Civil Code...I challenge him .</p>
