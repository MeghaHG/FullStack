                PM Modi began his address with a 'Namaste' and thanked everyone for coming from far away to attend the
                event at the UN headquarters.
                Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the Yoga Day celebrations at the UN headquarters on Wednesday, calling
                it "truly universal" and free from copyrights and patents. The prime minister, wearing a customised
                white yoga T-shirt and trousers, also performed yoga at the event along with the people.

                PM Modi, who is in New York as part of his three-day state visit to the US at the invitation of
                President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden, began his address with a 'Namaste' and thanked everyone
                for coming from far away to attend the event.
                The historic yoga session was attended by top UN officials, ambassadors, envoys, delegates from Member
                States as well as prominent people from more than 180 countries.

                The first International Day of Yoga was celebrated in 2015 and has since then been marked at several
                iconic global locations.

                Here are PM Modi's top five quotes:
                - "Yoga comes from India and it is a very old tradition. Yoga is free from copyrights, patents and
                royalty payments."

                - "Yoga is adaptable to your age, gender and fitness level. Yoga is portable and is truly universal."

                - "Yoga means to unite."

                - "Yoga expands the inner vision, and connects us with that consciousness which makes us feel the unity
                of the living being, giving a basis of love for the living being."
                - "We have to eliminate our contradictions, blockages and resistances through Yoga. We have to present
                the spirit of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’ as an example to the world."

                The meeting, scheduled on June 23, could boost the Opposition’s morale and give the saffron party
                sleepless nights

                By Mausami Singh, Rahul Gautam: Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is set to turn host as he readies
                to welcome leaders of almost 20 opposition parties in Patna on June 23 for a grand opposition
                meeting. The event could, perhaps, turn the Lok Sabha finale into an intense battle
                The mega-meet could pump up the Opposition’s morale, which has been plagued by constant squabbling
                and one-upmanship and give the BJP sleepless nights. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal spelt out
                his expectations of the Opposition meeting that will be held at the residence of Nitish Kumar.
                Days ahead of the meeting, Kejriwal threw the ball in Congress's court when asked what the grand old
                party would do on the ordinance issue. "I hope all parties in that meeting ask Congress to clear its
                stand. I think the first agenda of that meeting will be the Centre's ordinance that ends democracy
                in Delhi. I will carry a copy of the Constitution with me. I will explain to all parties that they
                should not think that Delhi is a UT, so this has been brought just for itâ€æ” he replied.

            <h2>How celebrities are quitting the BJP in Kerala</h2>
            <p class="p3">Three film personalities have severed ties with the party in less than a fortnight
            With less than a year to go for the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP in Kerala is facing multiple challenges. Even
            as the party struggles to impress crucial voting segments, such as the youth and women, it has suffered a
            setback with some celebrities lately snapping ties.

            The BJP aspires to win five Lok Sabha seats from Kerala in 2024. The party has been working on new
            strategies to win over Christians and managed to reach out to the Syro-Malabar Church. But its attempt to
            float a Christian political outfit did not work out. In Kerala’s bipolar politics, Christians are a crucial
            lot as they make up 18 per cent of the population and are economically and socially powerful. However, the
            handling of the volatile situation in Manipur has disheartened many BJP sympathisers among Christians.
            To add to it, film celebrities who had joined the BJP with much fanfare in 2016 have snapped ties as they
            feel the state leadership is ignoring them. Malayalam filmmaker Rajasenan was the first (June 3) to announce
            the decision. He said he would be joining the CPI(M). Rajasenan met CPI(M) state secretary M.V. Govindan
            Master, who welcomed him into the party.

            The BJP had fielded 64-year-old Rajasenan as its candidate from Aruvikkara in the 2016 assembly election. He
            finished third with around 20,000 votes. Rajasenan was inducted into the BJP state executive but was unhappy
            about apparently not being given any role in the affairs of the party. ”I wasted my years with the BJP and
            realised my mistake. I have decided to join the CPI(M) as the party treats artistes with dignity,” Rajasenan
            told INDIA TODAY.
            Three days after Rajasenan’s exit, actor Damodar Raghu announced his decision to quit the BJP. He had joined
            the party in 2016 and contested the assembly polls from Pathanapuram, where he received only 11,700 votes.
            Raghu, 69, has more than 300 movies to his credit in a three-decades-long career.
            A week later, director Ramasimhan Aboobakker, popularly known as Ali Akbar, resigned from the BJP on June
            15. Aboobakker, 60, was a state committee member of the party.

            BJP state president K. Surendran played down the resignations and maintained that the party had treated the
            film personalities well. “All three of them were given opportunities in the assembly polls. The BJP in
            Kerala is not in a position to offer them coveted posts as we are in the opposition,” Surendran remarked.

            The resignations have put the BJP state leadership on the back foot as celebrities have huge appeal among
            the people and help create a buzz during electioneering. “It’s unfortunate that they (celebrities) left the
            party and two of them joined the CPI(M). Despite our sincere efforts, intellectuals and celebrities are
            keeping a distance from the party,” a senior BJP leader said. “We have to design new strategies to win their
            confidence. Otherwise, the BJP will remain in the shadows in Kerala.”</p>
